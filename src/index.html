                        Hi my name is Lee. Iâ€™m from France and I do a lot of things, but my principal occupation is to create 3D experiences for people using Three.js. I love developing 3D experience because I always try or learn something new as the project goes by. Every project that I do is an occasion for me to push the limit of what I can do and understand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I strive to improve every day, particularly in this field. I am a reflective individual who questions myself to progress towards the goals I have set. Front-end development, particularly in 3D, resonates with me because I can witness the results of my work. What fascinates me about the 3D experience is the attention to detail; some cool effects that may go unnoticed to the casual observer but demand considerable time and effort, such as meticulously crafting shaders for minute elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a long time of self-learning Three.js, I made up my mind to become a freelancer in this domain. I desire to help people achieve their vision of their project. I want to make people as satisfied as I can while exploring and developing my creativity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
